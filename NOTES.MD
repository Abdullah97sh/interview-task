- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization
  methods? describe by example, if possible.

```
In general, the normalization is clculation method apply it to my data, in a way related to what I am comparing it to.

The z-score represent the position of value in terms of its distance from the mean. If z-score is 0, that means the value match the maen or close to mean,
if z-score is positeve that means means the value is above the mean point, 
and if it negative, thats mens thw value is below thw mean point.

In Min-Max scaling the lowest value equal to 0, the highest value equal to 1, and other values are equals between 1 and 0.
Like in this task, the highest salary is 2953  represent as 1, and the lowest salary is 299 represent as 0.

We need to use normalization methods because it enable us to read the data more easier and cmpare between them. 
 
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? what is unit testing and
  why would we use it?

```
The library has a code, it is like tools that help us in our work, instead of write the code from scratch we use it.  
Unit test is a class that have one or more test case, the programmer use it to make sure that the
code will do something as his expectation.
```

- What is the IDE did you use?

```
IntelliJ
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?

```
io; BufferedReader
math; BigDecimal; RoundingMode
nio.file.Path
util; List; Collections; Arrays; ArrayList; stream.Collectors;
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.

```
I faced difficulty to understand normalization word, I think if it expressed in a simple way it would be better. :D
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file

```
1. Provide an executable jar file; I made the Main class and add the main method inside it, then i made the executable jar
from the intelliJ.

2. Create in the unit tests two new test cases, for invalid destination path. And I coverage Normalize class all liens and methods.

3. I added a third bonus point which is not mentioned here, I created new repository in my Github account 
https://github.com/Abdullah97sh/interview-task and push the code there.
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how:

```
1. I learnd about CSV files and Json, and about its syntax.
2. First I used Scanner, then I read more and prefer to use BufferedReader to read and write CSV.
3. I learned how to create executable jar file.
4. I learned about unit test, how to write it, and how to check the coverage of the code.
5. Get some skills techniques for clean code, like combine duplicate code in one method.

```
